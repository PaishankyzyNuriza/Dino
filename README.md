The dino game is a simple infinite runner, in which you jump over cacti, and dodge upcoming obstacles.<br>
This Python Program is coded to play the dino game. In this game you will jump over cactuses, and get points, also you have 5 hearts. Each time when
you are touching cactus you will lose one heart . When you dont have any hearts, the game will end.<br>
The program uses the position of the dinosaur on the screen to relatively scan for upcoming obstacles and correctly time the upcoming jumps.
