The dino game is a simple infinite runner, in which you jump over cacti, and dodge upcoming obstacles.<br>
This Python Program is coded to play the dino game. In this game you will jump over cactuses, and get points, also you have 5 hearts. Each time when
you are touching cactus you will lose one heart . When you dont have any hearts, the game will end.<br>
The program uses the position of the dinosaur on the screen to relatively scan for upcoming obstacles and correctly time the upcoming jumps.
Instructions to use:<br>
Just run the program and enjoy playing.If you want pause press 'ESC' button, press 'Enter' to continue. "SPACE" button to jump. "Enter" to play again, "ESC" to exit. Also you can switch off background music by pressing "UP" button, to switch on "DOWN" button. Enjoy playing :)
