Hello

I will criticize  this work, done by Tamerlam and Nuriza
this game is Dinosaur, so I have played many times it when internet was off .
And her game is more interesting and have more functions than the game which is on Google.She did  the counting lifes, gives opportunity to play more. You can pause , you can switch off music . In fact,  the game looks very good. Also I liked that her code is easy to understand. 
I really appreciate that she made this famous and an enjoyable game .
It would be better if she added some other features , like double jumping.
Totally, I would say , Great job!
